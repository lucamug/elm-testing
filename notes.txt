Elm has managed effects, meaning that things like HTTP requests or writing to disk are all treated as data.

There are two managed effects: Cmd and Sub (Commands and Subscriptions)

Commands (Cmd) are how we tell the runtime to execute things that involve side effects (random numbers, http requests, etc.)

Cmd.batch to execute several commands

"parameterized types"
